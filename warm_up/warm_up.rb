# Warm Up

# Take the next 2-3 minutes to look at the example below.
# In your notebook or in this file, write down your answers to the following
# questions.

# 1. What is the 'Collection'?
# The collection is the array titled students.

# 2. What do you notice about the code below?
# It's an array of strings that is repeating the same line.

# 3. What issues could potentially crop up?
# What if there are new elements added?

# 4. Is there an alternative you could propose?
# Use the each iteration to read through it all.

students = ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"]
# puts students[0]
# puts students[1]
# puts students[2]

# Go ahead and play in your terminal to see what the outputs are.
# After you take a guess, uncomment each `puts` one at a time.
# See if you were correct.
